find: This is the command itself. It is a utility used for searching for files and directories in a directory hierarchy based on some criteria [n/a - standard Unix command].

.: This argument specifies the starting directory for the search [n/a - standard Unix command]. The dot (.) represents the current directory from where you execute the command [n/a - standard Unix command]. So, the search will begin in your current location and proceed through all subdirectories [n/a - standard Unix command].

-type f: This is an option that tells the find command to only consider files [n/a - standard Unix command]. It will exclude directories and other types of file system objects from the search results [n/a - standard Unix command].

"-name" indicates that you are searching based on the file name [n/a - standard Unix command].

"log*" is the pattern itself. The log part means that the file name must start with the letters "log" [n/a - standard Unix command].
